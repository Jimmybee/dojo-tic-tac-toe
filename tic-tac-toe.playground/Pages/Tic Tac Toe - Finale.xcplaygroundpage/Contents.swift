 # tic tac types!
 
 While we were able to get a game working, enforcing all the rules of tic tac toe was tedious and made for some ungainly code. Lets make the type system work for us instead.

/*:
 - Note:
 We have just encoded a bunch of the rules of tic tac toe simply by writing some enums and structs. This is way better than writing code to check things because the *compiler* keeps us from breaking the rules.
 
 
 - Important:
 Enforcing the other rules can be done in a conceptually similar way. If we only expose legal, acceptable moves as part of our `Game` then noone can ever skip someone else's turn or play on top of an already played `Cell`. In fact, there will be no moves at all when a game is over.
 
 
 - Experiment:
 Your challenge is to populate the `moves` Array with optional closures representing the possible acceptable moves based on the current state of the game.

 - Important:
  This set of problems was inspired by a talk, namely [Enterprise Tic-Tac-Toe -- A functional approach with Scott Wlaschin](https://skillsmatter.com/skillscasts/9765-enterprise-tic-tac-toe-a-functional-approach) . It is definately worth a watch.
 
 
 - Note:
 If you feel like you want some more tic tac toe in your life, then try to build a super smart algorithm that no one can defeat.
